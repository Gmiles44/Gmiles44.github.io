            <p>This is a browser-based crafting game, the final project of the CS50X 2024 course.
                It uses Python as the back-end language, SQLite as the database, and HTML and CSS as the front end (There's a bit of JavaScript in there
                too but it's not as widely utilized, most of the action is through HTTP requests.). In it
                you are a blacksmith living in a village, buying materials from travelling merchants (who change
                from day to day) to craft items to sell back and buy more materials, levelling up and getting access to better
                recipes, materials, and merchants. It's very simple but I had fun making it!  </p>
